## Description
- Tromsø Science Museum is a demo website for showcasing the exhibits and events of the fictional Tromsø Science Museum.
- The design aimed to cater to both adults and children, ensuring a compelling and engaging experience for all visitors to the museum.

## Features
- Footage showcasing interactive exhibits and engaging experiences was carefully selected and licensed to create captivating content for the landing page.
- The museum logo and iconography were chosen to represent the diverse fields of science and technology explored within the museum's exhibits.

## Design Process 

### Logo and Iconography  

The museum logo, with its computer chip-like appearance, represents the field of artificial intelligence, a key component of modern science, and what will likely define the generation we’re expecting to visit the museum. 

It pairs effectively with the helix icon in the overlay menu, which symbolizes the DNA structure and the biological aspect of science.  

By complementing each other visually, these design elements advocate for the balanced coexistence of biological science with the burgeoning field of AI and advanced technology, illustrating their equal significance in the field of modern science. 

I am very pleased with this thematic. It is also present in the landing page video. 

### Target Audience Consideration 

I aimed to create a compelling first impression with the landing page, focusing on making it visually stimulating and engaging. The design was informed by my study of media & communication theory, in this case particularly regarding young people's perceptual tendencies.  

Key factors included: 

- Short attention spans 

- Preference for bold color contrasts 

- Showcasing interactive experiences 

#### Dual Audience Strategy

The design was made to cater to two demographics: adults and children.  

Recognizing that children are less likely to be influenced by - or even visit - more informational pages like contact forms or terms & conditions, I concentrated on making the index page particularly captivating and the main focus of my design.   

Conversely, I adopted a simpler, more straightforward design for the informational sections, targeting adult users. 

The primary goal was to depict an environment where everything is hands-on, as I believe this interactivity is a key factor in attracting young visitors.
